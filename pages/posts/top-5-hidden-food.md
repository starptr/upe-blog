Assuming that you’re a Cal student or Berkeley resident, you’ve probably been to all of the most popular restaurants around campus. Yes, I’m talking about you, Top Dog and Imm Street Thai. While Berkeley staples and Cal foodie institutions are great, it’s time to shed some light on the lesser known yet equally delicious joints around campus. As a foodie of 19 years and counting, I used my gastronomical acumen to curate a list of five Berkeley restaurants that are criminally underrated and within close proximity to campus. In fact, I’d label them as must-tries if you’re ever in the area. So, sit back, relax, and be sure to have a snack around since you will certainly be hungry by the time this blog post is finished.

## #1 Cafenated Coffee Company
With the plethora of cafes around campus, it’s often challenging to find one that particularly stands out. However, with solid coffee and delectable food, Cafenated Coffee Company does a damn good job at outshining the rest of Cal’s cafe competition.

To preface, I’m a die-hard black coffee drinker. I find that in order to appreciate a cafe’s beans, it’s best to drink coffee in it’s untampered, unfussy state: black. However, I will give up my religious black coffee habit for Cafenated Coffee Company’s cappuccino. Seriously, their cappuccino is a must-get, and it’s worth the lactase pill that I bring every time. The steamed milk is frothy, luscious, and everything you’d want on a brisk, Berkeley day.

Aside from drinks, Cafenated Coffee Company offers an array of breakfast & lunch options (all of which are nothing but delicious). My personal favorite is the “On-The-Run” sandwich, a sandwich loaded with bacon, egg, parmesan cheese, and other savory ingredients atop a ciabatta bun. What’s especially unique about this sammie is that it features a sun dried tomato jam which helps to cut the fattiness of the bacon with the nuanced acidity. How divine!

## #2 Banh Mi & Roll Factory
If anyone knows me, they’ll know my strong affinity for Banh Mi & Roll Factory. About a year ago, I went on a hunt for the best banh mi in Berkeley, ultimately trying Freshroll, Nom Nom, and other banh mi spots. And, with cost and flavor factored in, Banh Mi & Roll Factory was the reigning champ.

Unlike other banh mi joints, they offer two sizes of sandwich: the mini and the regular. Additionally, they always promote their Vietnamese coffee deals where you can get either 2 mini banh mi’s or 1 regular banh mi plus an iced coffee for sub 10 bucks. Given the skyrocketing prices in Berkeley, it’s a deal you really can’t beat.

Fun fact: if you order three banh mi’s, you get one free! So, be sure to bring a friend or two or three! Alternatively, you can order four for yourself. Don’t worry, I’m not judging.

## #3 Sushinista
A friend introduced me to Sushinista only recently, and I’m hooked. This cute and quaint mom-and-pop shop is situated on the outskirts of Downtown Berkeley and definitely easy to miss. Tucked away in a small building across Berkeley High School, Sushinista sells tasty sushi burritos wrapped in nori -Japanese dried seaweed- and filled with meats (or veggies) of your choice.

The burritos are a pretty good deal -with unagi burritos being only $14 a pop- and one can sustain me from breakfast up until dinner time. I’ve yet to try a majority of their menu, but with the mouthwatering smells coming out of the restaurant, I’m positive the whole menu is pretty solid.

One thing I will note is that the place does tend to be pretty crowded around noon due to the increased foot traffic from Berkeley High students. But, if you don’t mind long lines nor being mistaken for a high school student, then by all means, visit Sushinista.

## #4 Palm Açai Café
There was a time where I had an intense açai phase. I’m talking about the “I-need-to-have-a-smoothie-bowl-at-least-thrice-a-week-or-I-will-most-definitely-lose-my-marbles” açai phase. My wallet sustained heavy blows during that trying time, but at the very least, I developed my smoothie bowl palate and tried a variety of smoothie bowls around the Bay Area. And, one thing I can say for certain is that Palm does a great job at their smoothie bowls.

My go-to is the hunter bowl which is a bit ironic considering no hunting was actually involved to make the hunter bowl. Suffice to say, the whole bowl is 100% meat-free, but you probably knew that already. The açai-based bowl is adorned with blueberries, cacao nibs, honey, and granola, not to mention it’s laden with velvety drizzles of peanut butter. While a majority of the bowl’s individual components are sweet, as a cohesive bowl, it isn’t overwhelmingly sweet at all. In fact, Palm manages to balance the earthiness of the granola with the acidity of the fruit which makes for one pretty awesome bite. I will mention that Palm isn’t a daily element of the Audrey diet (or else I’d be destitute by the time I hit 25), but regardless, Palm’s smoothies and bowls are a delightful “treat-yourself” meal!

## #5 Southside Station
Last, but certainly not least is Southside Station. With all candor, I don’t really know where to start with this review, because even thinking about this restaurant renders me speechless. But, I guess I should start with their coveted flagship chicken sandwich. Unlike your plain Jane chicken sandwich @Chick-fil-A, Southside Station adds a Thai-inspired flare to their sandwiches by stuffing them with a juicy Thai fried chicken thigh and tangy papaya salad slaw. The sandwich is also served inside a buttery brioche bun with a generous smear of sriracha mayo. Although I’m a big World Famous Hotboy’s fan, I believe that Southside Station is the only other contender for the Bay’s best chicken sandwich award. I might even venture to say that World Famous Hotboys places second but a very close second at that.

Aside from the sandwich, Southside Station also offers Thai-flavored pizzas, delicious side dishes ranging from organic brussel sprouts to flavorful garlic noodles, and a variety of drinks such as Lychee Sangria. Pretty much everything at Southside Station bats a 1000 in my book!

The ambiance is a bit odd as you have to order from a window inside the restaurant and then take a seat at one of two tables. But, if you’re fine with a no-frills chicken sandwich experience, then this is the place for you!
